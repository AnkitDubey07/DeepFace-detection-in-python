🎭 DEEPFACE DETECTION IN PYTHON 🎭

Team Name : 👉 HeraPheri 👈

Project Description : In our project , the basic idea resolves around the face . As the face is important in every profile verification process just  to be a legit consumer or customer , but there are some organisations which are continuously trying to fake this process using fake pictures . Thus , python provides a wide range of libraries to tackle this issue and we have following libraries 🗂️ ;
1. DeepFace
2. Open CV : cv2
3. Tensorflow
4. Keras
5. Numpy
6. Matplotlib.pyplot
7. Pandas , time , random , json & etc .

With above libraries it is easy to solve picture related issues. In end we have authenticity of pictures with  the person uploading it .

We took help from SERENGIL's github and youtube channel 🎬 .

Overview : we firstly , imported some useful libraries and then we used difine fuction ( def _(__): ) .
Then we import our datasets which contains some pictures to test and train our model and finally we have our corrected predictions of various pictures . 🎭✔️
